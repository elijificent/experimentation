# Experimentation

I spent a lot of time performing A/B tests, and thought it
would be useful to layout many of the important aspects/
create a tool for working with them. They are very helpful 
in understanding how new features affect users and how they
interact with the site, performing percentage rollouts for new features,
and quantifying the individual results of individual features.
